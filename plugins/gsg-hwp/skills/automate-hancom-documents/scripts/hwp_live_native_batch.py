    made the next caller buy that same verdict again.

    A zero text length is refused rather than read as an empty document: the

    """Bind a complete revision token into store_epoch for cache freshness.

    Every graph tool this worker serves takes this path. ``hwp_mcp.main``
    builds the server with the deferred production graph client, which resolves
    the connected window per query and goes through
    ``production_native_graph_client``; that client binds here before it asks
    the cache anything. So ``hwp_get_graph_manifest``, ``hwp_query_graph``,
    ``hwp_get_graph_node``, ``hwp_get_graph_property`` and
    ``hwp_get_graph_asset`` all decide reuse on a token read. The paths that
    must prove two documents identical rather than date one -- undo/redo
    preconditions, checkpoint restore, rollback evidence -- keep calling
    ``read_native_content_signature`` and are untouched by this.

    This asks how old the document is, not what is in it, so it reads the cheap
    revision token rather than the whole-document signature the checkpoint and
    history paths still require. Reading a signature here cost 6.2s on a 34-page
    82MB document and 12.9s on a 102-page one, every time, because a write
    empties the cache -- and the answer was thrown away except as a cache key.

    An unusable token is not a reason to reuse anything: the caller is told the
    generation is not reusable and republishes, exactly as it did when a
    signature was unavailable.

    What the token alone cannot see, and what covers it. The signature carried
    a normalized HWPML document hash; the token does not, and that one field is
    the whole of the difference. A change the token is blind to -- character,
    paragraph and table formatting including borders and shading, control
    geometry and ordering, an image replaced in place, style definitions, and
    page setup that leaves the page count alone -- moves the token's write
    epoch only when the write goes through the bridge's Invoke. When it goes
    through Hangul's own automation instead, which ``HAction.Execute``/
    ``HAction.Run`` callers such as hwp_live_table_format.py:52,
    hwp_page_setup.py:123 and hwp_live_caption_edit.py:21 do, or when a person
    edits by hand, it reaches this worker only as an engine change event. That
    event bumps the window's freshness counter
    (``note_native_window_content_change``), and the epoch binds the counter
    next to the token, so the recaptured-but-bit-identical token no longer
    re-issues the pre-edit key. Two dependencies remain and are accepted:
    events arrive only while HancomEventBridge is alive, and events raised
    while no worker was alive are gone -- the persisted watermark answers the
    second by resuming the counter past everything ever bound, at the price of
    one republish per worker restart. A caller that must not trust the event
    channel at all wants ``read_native_content_signature``.

    In this worker that gap is narrower than the list suggests, and the reason
    is worth stating exactly rather than hoping. The token's write epoch --
    ``gWriteEpoch`` in BatchAutomation.cpp -- is bumped around every member
    ``MemberWritesDocument`` names, and the production formatting tools all
    reach the document through one of them: ``hwp_format_text``,
    ``hwp_format_table``, ``hwp_merge_table_cells``, ``hwp_split_table_cell``
    and ``hwp_apply_style`` run the native format contract in
    hwp_live_native_format_recipe.py, which writes via ``execute_native_actions``
    -> ``ExecuteActions``. A formatting-only write issued by this worker
    therefore does move the token.

    The ``HAction.Execute``/``HAction.Run`` callers that bypass the bridge are
    hwp_live_table_format.py, hwp_page_setup.py, hwp_live_caption_edit.py and
    hwp_assembly.py. None of them is a formatting-only write the worker can
    serve stale: an AST import closure over hwp_mcp (352 local modules, 314
    reachable) puts hwp_page_setup and hwp_assembly outside the worker entirely
    -- they are reachable only from the hwp_automation CLI -- and the other two
    are reachable only inside ``insert_table``, which adds a table and its text
    and so moves the token's control count, control hash, text hash and text
    length regardless.

    What is left uncovered is a change this process never issued: a person
    editing by hand, or a sibling worker driving the same Hangul outside the
    bridge. This is a real hole, not a narrowed one. The engine change event
    drops this worker's cached token, but the token it then re-reads is
    byte-identical when the edit was formatting-only, so a generation published
    before the edit stays reusable; and the event path depends on
    HancomEventBridge being alive at all. Closing it needs either a normalized
    HWPML hash in the token (a C++ change this lane did not make) or an
    event-driven epoch salt that survives a worker restart (a persistence layer
    this lane did not build). Nothing here pretends otherwise.

    ``read_native_content_signature`` is not a general escape from that hole.
    On documents large enough to matter the engine answers ``S_OK`` with an
    empty string -- measured at 17.4s and no usable signature on a 38-page
    document -- so a caller that switches to it to catch a manual formatting
    change gets neither the change nor an error.

    The C++ comments at BatchAutomation.cpp:98-106 and OfficialApiState.h:84-90
    still say a caller who needs to notice a formatting change needs a
    signature, without the qualification above. They are stale in that respect
    and were left alone: this lane made no C++ change.

    The graph route stays audit-only regardless. Structure reads keep the legacy
    path -- a warm graph check measured 518 to 739 times slower -- and this
    freshness bind is what makes the audit route cheap enough to re-ask, not an
    invitation to move reads onto it.

    The epoch is the token and nothing else, deliberately. Anything mixed in
    from this process's memory -- a route generation, a write counter -- returns
    to its starting value when the worker restarts while Hangul keeps running,
    and the epoch then returns to a key some earlier generation was already
    published under. The token cannot do that: its session tag is the Hangul
    process id, so it changes when Hangul restarts and is stable when it does
    not.
