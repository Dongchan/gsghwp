# Hancom Document Automation

Start with the production action path: match the request to one public tool and call it. Read a reference only when the work in front of you needs what that reference holds.

## Images in a request

Read a visible value directly and call its matching write. For image or PPT structure reconstruction, read `references/native-layout.md` (identical MCP resource: `gsg-hwp-beta://reference/native-layout`). That reference is the sole reconstruction workflow; this entrypoint only routes to it.

## Non-negotiable rules

- Route every Hancom/HWP edit, analysis, and verification request through the `gsg-hwp-beta-live` MCP and this skill.
- Treat a change as successful only after the selected public tool reaches a terminal success result and its operation-specific readback confirms the requested state. A dispatched call or mutation attempt without that readback is not success.
- Choose the most specific public action tool for the user's request. Never invent an API name, cell address, control ID, or hidden execution field.
- Before every public write, choose a caller-owned `operation_id` (for example, a UUID) and keep it unchanged until that logical operation reaches a terminal result. Reuse the same ID only when retrying the same payload or recovering a lost response; use a new ID for an intentional second execution, even when its payload is identical. Never derive the ID from the payload. The same ID with different inputs is a conflict. Completed results remain replayable for up to 30 days by default; when the terminal journal exceeds 10,000 records or 64 MiB, the oldest terminal results are evicted first. Never recycle an ID after journal expiry or a `not_found` response.
- Live mode attaches only to the exact active, saved, editable HWP already registered in ROT. It does not open, save, clear, quit, or change history by default. Use `hwp_undo` or `hwp_redo` only for an explicit history request, and `hwp_save_reopen_verify` only for an explicit save-and-reopen verification request.
- Never use `computer-use`, Windows UI automation, keyboard/mouse control, or a Python COM document call as a fallback for an HWP operation. If the `gsg-hwp-beta-live` MCP is unavailable, disconnected, or returns a closed transport, report that exact state and stop. If a certified native operation is unavailable, return the structured result from the selected HWP tool and stop.
- Do not hard-code a document title, page number, table size, or cell map in reusable code.
- When the user asks to analyze or verify how an open HWP page looks, call `hwp_render_page`; it preserves document state and uses HWP `CreatePageImage`. Do not render in the middle of a fill, repeat, sync, or Excel append. For cell text, IDs, merges, or sizes use `hwp_inspect_page_fast` with `include_cells=true`. `hwp_inspect_structure` is not the cell-text readback.
- `hwp_render_page` publishes each completed PNG at a unique path only after `CreatePageImage` finishes. Active session directories are protected by a worker ownership lock. Released results have a 24-hour TTL and at least a 15-minute client-read grace; cleanup runs at worker startup and every 15 minutes, removes abandoned partial files, and evicts the oldest eligible results when the preview store exceeds 64 MiB.
- Document-local styles are read with `hwp_list_styles`; never use web search to infer a style ID or local title convention.
- For an explicit convention-matching write, read `observed_usage.convention_profile` once and reuse only values the target document actually reports. Check each axis's `sample_count`, `consistency`, `complete`, variants, scope, and `write_fields`; never turn a conflicting or partial sample into a universal template.
- An `unobserved` convention axis is missing evidence, not a reason to refuse the edit. Leave that write field unchanged unless the user supplied it explicitly, and continue with the observed axes the write tool supports.
- Table-series tools copy the first table, regenerate each copied automatic-number control, and update only the literal title suffix while preserving the source caption style. Do not follow a successful series call with manual `hwp_add_caption` calls. If caption verification fails, report that failure instead of retrying captions or Undo in a loop.
- After a plugin update, stay in the current Codex task and call `hwp_runtime_info`. The stable MCP proxy reloads the worker automatically when its source hash changes and emits a tool-list change notification; call `hwp_reload` only to force a reload. Compare `mcp`, `worker_process_id`, `source_path`, and `tool_schema_hash` before continuing. `native_bridge` is only the version this build expects; `loaded_native_bridge` is the bridge DLL the running Hangul editor actually has mapped, read from its module list, and it is only ever asked of `Hwp.exe` — Hancom's `HwpApi.exe` automation host never loads the bridge and is not evidence about it. The bridge verdict is reported, never enforced: it does not gate any operation and never by itself makes you stop, refuse, or restart Hangul. Continue the requested work and pass `native_bridge_notice` through to the user when `native_bridge_state` is anything other than `matched`. Only `native_bridge_state="mismatched"` (`hangul_restart_required=true`) proves a stale DLL is executing right now; `not_loaded` means that Hangul started before this bridge was registered and the next Hangul start picks it up on its own. Never restart Hangul on your own initiative — the user may have unsaved work open; state the notice and let the user decide. If the refreshed direct tool is not yet visible, call it through `hwp_execute` with the exact tool name and arguments.
- The host may expose this skill directly from the plugin manifest, from a host cache, or through a legacy global Junction. Read the exact displayed `SKILL.md` path directly without assuming its storage form; do not locate, search, or compare other cache or installation paths.
- For table data keyed by visible header labels, use `records`. Use `cells` only with verified cell addresses and `rows` only when the user supplied an explicit `start_cell`. A returned `target_id` changes only the target, never the chosen data format.
- Explicit 1 mm table rows and columns are supported. To make the physical cell reach that size, set every affected cell to `font_size_pt=1`, `line_spacing_percent=50`, and zero padding; larger inherited text or padding can make HWP expand the cell. HWP stores 1 mm as 283 HWPUNIT, so inspection reports about 0.998 mm per row or column.
- For an irregular or partially merged table, use the inspected `CellTopology`: actual cell address, `row_span`, `column_span`, and physical right/down neighbours. Never synthesize `F1`, `A11`, or an address-distance move sequence. Column and row formatting starts at the requested real cell; merging proceeds only through the recorded neighbour path after the covered owners form a gap-free rectangle.
- `hwp_split_table_cell` has two deliberately different modes. Use `split_mode="equal"` only to subdivide one unmerged physical cell. Use `split_mode="existing_grid"` only to restore the exact `row_span` × `column_span` grid hidden by a merged cell. Do not split a merged header merely to reach a column for formatting; format the real intersecting cell instead. A requested existing-grid split that does not match the inspected spans must be rejected before mutation.
- `hwp_apply_page_plan` keeps each block's absolute `box.top_mm`. It does that by writing the planned gap into the paragraph spacing of the block below it, which is the only vertical control a flow layout has; that channel is filled by the compiler and is deliberately absent from the published layout schema, so a layout tool cannot send it and a plan cannot ask for placement by hand. Blocks are emitted top-first regardless of declaration order. A block whose plan box overlaps the one above it, or whose content is taller than its box, is pushed down rather than moved up, and everything after it is measured from where it really ends. Positions land within about 0.2 mm; a plan whose content genuinely exceeds the body is rejected with the millimetres it is short.
- Use `hwp_insert_layout` for live insertion away from the document end. `layout.target=current` inserts at the user's collapsed cursor. `layout.target=after_page` with `page=N` inserts at the start of the existing next page and adds one trailing page break, so it creates exactly one isolated page without a blank page; after the last page it appends with one leading page break. Do not add another `page_break` block. Continue to use `hwp_append_layout` only for the document end.
- For screenshot or reference-layout reconstruction, restore the evidence-first sequence: call `hwp_analyze_reference_image` once with `full_scan=true`, inspect its overlay/contact sheets, let the model choose semantic elements and loose raster boxes, then call `hwp_prepare_image_crops` once. Mark rectangular photos as `tight_raster` and annotated maps/drawings/logos as `annotated_group`; crop preparation resolves the final boundaries and returns a boundary overlay while the model still owns meaning. In native tables, apply visible-surface ownership recursively: group title bands, repeated-item subheading pills, and their body boxes are separate cells or rows, never line-broken text inside one cell.
- Never delete and rebuild a page for a local correction. Use `hwp_patch_text` for a sentence or line break, table formatting tools for an existing ordinary table, image replace/size paths for one picture, and `reference_layout_patch` for existing reference-grid rows, columns, styles, or edges. Rebuild only when structural inspection proves that no local target can represent the requested correction.
- `headers` filters target tables; it is not a copy of the `records` keys. Use only labels known to be visibly present in the target table. If a page already narrows the request sufficiently, pass `page` without speculative `headers`.

## Skill registration ownership and migration

The plugin manifest (`.codex-plugin/plugin.json` with `"skills": "./skills/"`) is the normal and only active owner of this skill. MCP worker startup reports manifest and legacy-path status but never creates, replaces, or removes anything under the global Codex skills directory.

For an existing installation, migrate in this order:

1. Confirm the installed plugin exposes `automate-hancom-documents` from its manifest. A missing global Junction is the expected state.
2. Inspect the old path without changing it: `Get-Item -LiteralPath (Join-Path $codexHome "skills\automate-hancom-documents") -Force | Select-Object LinkType, Target`, where `$codexHome` is the configured `CODEX_HOME` or the user `.codex` directory.
3. Remove that path only when it is a Junction and its resolved target is exactly this plugin's `skills\automate-hancom-documents` directory. Leave a real directory, an unreadable path, or a Junction to another installation untouched.
4. Reconnect the plugin and confirm the host exposes one skill entry.

From the installed plugin root, this PowerShell guard removes only the current plugin's own Junction and stops on every other path:

```powershell
$codexHome = if ($env:CODEX_HOME) { [IO.Path]::GetFullPath($env:CODEX_HOME) } else { Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE ".codex" }
$legacySkill = Join-Path $codexHome "skills\automate-hancom-documents"
$currentSkill = (Resolve-Path ".\skills\automate-hancom-documents").Path
$item = Get-Item -LiteralPath $legacySkill -Force
$junctionTarget = [IO.Path]::GetFullPath([string]$item.Target)
if ($item.LinkType -ne "Junction" -or $junctionTarget -ne $currentSkill) { throw "Refusing to remove a path not owned by this plugin" }
Remove-Item -LiteralPath $legacySkill
```

Only a legacy host that cannot discover manifest skills should install or repair the compatibility Junction explicitly with `uv run python .\skills\automate-hancom-documents\scripts\hwp_codex_skill_install.py`. The command accepts an absent path or the already-current Junction and refuses every other existing path. It is never called by MCP worker startup.

## Production action path

Match the user's request directly to one public action tool:

| User request | Tool | Distinction |
|---|---|---|
| Fill cells in an existing table | `hwp_fill_table` | Does not add rows; rows may start at the live selected cell/block when `start_cell` is omitted |
| Add rows and fill a table | `hwp_expand_and_fill_table` | Adds rows when needed |
| Repeat an empty table form | `hwp_repeat_table_template` | Does not fill each copy |
| Repeat a table and fill each copy | `hwp_build_table_series` | Accepts values and images per copy; advances a trailing caption number while inheriting its style |
| Sync preliminary viewpoints into visibility-analysis tables and numbered photos | `hwp_sync_visibility_analysis_tables` | Reads both tables by semantic headers, reconciles the complete series, and advances trailing caption numbers. Missing photo folders do not stop the table sync; the result reports how many photos were placed |
| Put images in table cells | `hwp_fill_table_images` | Keeps images inside a table |
| Format or resize an existing table | `hwp_format_table` | Omit `cell` to use the live current cell, selected contiguous cell block, or selected table; row/column sizes go down to 1mm |
| Merge table cells | `hwp_merge_table_cells` | Requires a rectangular range |
| Split one table cell | `hwp_split_table_cell` | Requires row/column counts and explicit `equal` or `existing_grid` semantics |
| Delete a physical page | `hwp_delete_page` | Verifies that page count decreases by one |
| Delete existing controls | `hwp_delete_control` | Uses one or more IDs returned by fast structure inspection |
| Undo a live edit | `hwp_undo` | Bounded to 1–20 explicit history steps |
| Redo a cancelled edit | `hwp_redo` | Bounded to 1–20 explicit history steps |
| Insert a new image | `hwp_insert_image` | Uses the selection or document end |
| Replace an existing image | `hwp_replace_image` | Uses the selected image or a returned target ID |
| Add or update a caption | `hwp_add_caption` | Uses the selection, a returned candidate, or a fast-inspection `instance_id` |
| Replace or delete user-selected text | `hwp_replace_selected_text` | Reads the dragged selection and original text internally; an empty replacement deletes it |
| Insert, replace, or format text without a selection | `hwp_patch_text` | Uses current cursor, an exact range, a unique find result, or a verified table cell and reads back only the changed range |
| Apply a document style | `hwp_apply_style` | Uses a style ID on the selection |
| Format selected text | `hwp_format_text` | Applies explicit text and paragraph properties |
| Analyze a reference image | `hwp_analyze_reference_image` | Returns a compact execution recommendation, verified coordinates, artifact paths, and a direct reference-layout draft when appropriate |
| Prepare model-selected image regions | `hwp_prepare_image_crops` | Refines loose semantic boxes into complete PNG assets without cutting attached labels, callouts, or legends |
| Read one detailed analysis section | `hwp_get_reference_image_analysis_section` | Pages only the requested object, text, line, breakpoint, tile, or artifact section |
| Check layout fit before writing | `hwp_preflight_layout` | Uses the live section's paper and margins and returns overflow risk, problem blocks, and safe adjustment choices |
| Insert text, a table, or a native layout in the middle | `hwp_insert_layout` | `current` uses the cursor; `after_page` plus `page` creates the requested following page |
| Append a layout | `hwp_append_layout` | Adds content only at the document end |
| Check or recover a write result | `hwp_get_operation_status` | Uses the original `operation_id`; returns committed results again and reports in-progress, failed, aborted, stale, or missing operations |
| Analyze or verify an HWP page | `hwp_render_page` | Uses `CreatePageImage` without changing document state |
| Save, reopen, and verify | `hwp_save_reopen_verify` | Use only for an explicit persistence check |

## Live speed

Natural-language edits must finish as one or two public writes, not a search-and-retry loop.

- Call the matching write immediately. Do not list documents, walk the disk, or inspect unrelated pages first.
- 예비조망점 → 가시권 개수·내용·사진: one `hwp_sync_visibility_analysis_tables`. If a photo folder is missing, still run it; report the photo gap from `input_guidance`. Do not copy the template nine times by hand.
- Excel 건축개요/층별/용도별: one `hwp_append_excel_table` without inventing `cell_range`. The tool splits empty-row/column gutters and wide merged header groups. Only pass a range after that call names one.
- Do not parallelize writes against one Hangul process.
- `hwp_render_page` is last-look verification or an explicit “화면 확인해” request. Use dpi 72 unless the user asked for a closer look.

1. For a write, choose its `operation_id`, then call the selected tool immediately. Do not precede it with capability, catalog, document-list, connect, or inspect calls. The one convention-matching exception is a single `hwp_list_styles` call when the write tool does not already resolve the document's own convention. Read tools (`hwp_inspect`, `hwp_inspect_page_fast`, `hwp_inspect_structure`, `hwp_render_page`, `hwp_list_styles`) also auto-connect and require no session ID. Use `hwp_inspect_page_fast` only when an exact existing object ID or structural readback is required. Its `instance_id` goes directly in `target_id` for `hwp_add_caption`, `hwp_replace_image`, and `hwp_fill_table`; tools whose schema has a `target` parameter, including `hwp_format_table`, `hwp_merge_table_cells`, and `hwp_split_table_cell`, receive `target: {"target_id": instance_id}`. `hwp_delete_control` receives it in `control_instance_ids`. The six graph tools are audit/full-document extract only; ordinary inspect uses `hwp_inspect_page_fast` / `hwp_inspect_structure`.
   If that exact tool is documented here but absent from the current client's tool list, call `hwp_execute` once with the exact `tool_name` and the same argument object. This is only a stale-catalog forwarder; it does not search or reinterpret the request. If `hwp_execute` is also absent, reconnect the `gsg-hwp-beta-live` MCP connection in the current task and call `hwp_runtime_info`; do not create a new task.
2. The tool connects the active editable document, resolves the target, performs the certified action, and verifies the result in the same call.
   When HWP loses foreground focus, its caret stops blinking but the current-or-last HWP position remains the active target. Do not replace it with the Codex input caret. `hwp_inspect.active_target` distinguishes a caret, current table cell, selected text, selected cell block, selected table, and other selected controls.
   After `succeeded`, continue without a blanket re-inspection when the response already supplies `affected_pages`, `state_token`, `selected_target_id`, and `affected_target_ids`. Use those fields to carry the verified page and target scope into the next logical operation. `retry_operation_id` is only for recovering the same payload after a lost response; a new operation still needs a new `operation_id`.
3. A public table tool automatically selects exactly one candidate only when the caller's `page`, `caption`, `headers`, or `table_index` actually narrowed the match to that candidate. A lone global fallback that does not satisfy those filters is not auto-selected, and genuinely multiple candidates return `needs_target`. Call the same tool again with one returned opaque ID in the exact field reported by `required_inputs`: direct `target_id` or nested `target.target_id`. Preserve the original data format. If it returns `needs_input`, use `required_inputs` and `input_guidance`; when `format_candidates` is empty and `cells` is requested, provide the final display strings directly instead of waiting for another candidate list.
4. If the response is lost or the caller disconnects after dispatch, call `hwp_get_operation_status` with the original `operation_id` and document selector. Retry the write only with that exact ID and unchanged payload. Ask the user only when the target candidates are genuinely multiple or a required user value is missing. Do not automatically retry any other failure.
5. Do not call generic `hwp_operate` in production. It remains a QA-only diagnostic surface documented in `references/qa-operation-internals.md`.

## Hancom MCP ribbon tab (custom actions, Stage 2)

When the user asks to put a repeated job on the Hangul ribbon — “툴바에 넣어줘”, “버튼으로 만들어”, “단축 기능 등록” — save the *already-decided* public tool calls as a custom action. Seven tools own this surface, and none of them open, read, or modify a document. They touch one JSON registry (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\HancomDocumentAutomation\custom-actions-v1\custom-actions.json`) and the ribbon.

| Task | Tool |
|---|---|
| List custom actions, optionally observe the live tab | `hwp_list_custom_actions` |
| Read one definition | `hwp_get_custom_action` |
| Add one and rebuild the tab | `hwp_register_custom_action` |
| Change label, description, or steps | `hwp_update_custom_action` |
| Remove one | `hwp_delete_custom_action` |
| Change button order | `hwp_reorder_custom_actions` |
| Uninstall the tab (`purge_registry` optionally drops the definitions) | `hwp_remove_custom_action_tab` |

Removing the tab is not permanent by itself: the worker rebuilds it the next time it attaches to that Hangul process, or on the next custom-action call. Say so when the user asks for it gone.

- A step is a public tool name plus its argument object, nothing else. The schema has no field for a raw HAction, COM member, or script macro. `step.tool` must belong to the current profile's forwardable public tools; `hwp_execute` and the seven custom-action tools themselves are refused, so a recipe can never express what `hwp_execute` could not, and can never call itself. The store re-validates the *whole* registry against the allowlist before every write, so a hand-edited file that smuggled in a forbidden tool cannot be laundered by a later `update`/`reorder` — those writes refuse until the tampered entry is deleted.
- Save only calls whose arguments you already confirmed with the user. Argument shapes are validated by the target tool at run time, not at save time. Natural-language prompts are deliberately not storable in v1.
- **Clicks run the recipe.** The bridge DLL (0.5.173) advertises a pool of 32 slot action IDs. A custom action's registry position *is* its slot, so a click carries a slot number, and the MCP worker maps that number back to the recipe and runs its steps through the same public tool path `hwp_execute` uses — same session scope, same argument normalization, same verification delegates, same operation journal. Outcomes land in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HancomDocumentAutomation\custom-actions-v1\click-journal.jsonl` and in `runtime.recent_outcomes` on `hwp_list_custom_actions(include_tab_state=true)`.
- **The worker must be alive for a button to be pressable.** The worker writes a heartbeat into the bridge's shared memory; `UpdateUI` reads its age and returns a disabled state once it goes stale. The DLL side is verified, and Hangul **does** poll `UpdateUI` for slot buttons once they exist on the ribbon — observed live (`slot_ui_enabled` flipped false→true after the tab was built, with a fresh worker heartbeat; a process with no buttons shows `updateUiCount=0` because there is nothing to poll). What remains unproven is only the visual: that a stale heartbeat actually renders the button grey (worker-death rendering has not been exercised live). Treat greying as expected but not yet demonstrated.
- **One click runs once, even with two MCP servers open.** Click sequences are claimed atomically in `click-claims.json` before execution, so a second worker attached to the same Hangul consumes nothing. The shared memory's `heartbeatWorkerPid` is last-writer-wins and cannot identify which worker holds the right to execute — only the claim ledger does.
- **The tab is there before you add anything.** The click loop composes the tab the moment the worker attaches to a Hangul process, straight from the registry. With zero registered actions that is a **default tab**: the `한컴MCP` tab carrying one seed button (`한컴MCP 연결`, the bridge's bootstrap AID, which re-publishes the ROT moniker when pressed) and `tab.default_tab = true`. Measured live: a tab with no toolbox at all *does* appear in the tab strip, but selecting it shows an empty ribbon body, so the seed button is there to make the tab mean something. The same attach path restores the tab after a Hangul restart — the new process is discovered and composed on its own, with no tool call. Composing is idempotent: if the ribbon already shows exactly what the registry says, nothing is torn down and `tab.rebuilt` comes back `false`. That matters because attach fires on every worker restart, and rebuilding a correct tab is pure COM work on Hangul's UI thread.
- **Edits reach the ribbon immediately; no Hangul restart.** Hangul caches the toolbox tab tree by tab key for the life of the process (measured live), so a key is poisoned once used. Every rebuild therefore deletes the old tab and stands a new one up under a **random, never-before-used key** (`{GSG-HWP-MCP-TAB-R…}`). Register, update, reorder, and delete all show up at once — verified live end to end. `tab.tab_key` and `tab.previous_tab_key` report exactly which keys were used; `tab.rebuilt` is `false` when the ribbon already matched and nothing was touched.
- **When the tab-key ledger is lost, say so.** The toolbar exposes no way to enumerate tabs, so the current key per process lives in `tab-keys.json` beside the registry. Keys are random precisely so that losing that file can never make the composer re-pick a burned key — adversarial testing showed the old sequential scheme restarting at 0, resurrecting Hangul's cached tree, and then reporting `absent`/`removed` for a tab that was still on screen. The cost is that a lost ledger leaves an **orphan tab** we can no longer find. That is reported, not hidden: `tab.tab_key_known` goes `false` and stays false for that process (the suspicion is written into the ledger record, so it survives later rebuilds and idempotent no-ops). The rebuild itself still succeeds — measured shape is `status="applied"` with `tab_key_known=false`. `status="unknown"` is narrower: it is what `observe`/`remove` return when they cannot find a tab *and* cannot rule one out, instead of claiming absence. The advisory says a Hangul restart clears the orphan. Only tabs from the older sequential scheme can still be swept (`tab.swept_tab_keys`). Two residual limits, stated plainly: the witness that tells "first attach" apart from "lost memory" is `slot-bindings.json`, which sits in the same folder as the ledger — deleting the whole folder takes both, and the next rebuild then looks like a clean first attach with no warning; and a PID reused by a new Hangul can be judged against whatever record survived for that number. Both end at the next Hangul restart, which clears every tab we could no longer see.
- **A ribbon that disagrees routes by what it shows.** If observation ever diverges from what was inserted (`tab.status="stale"`), the click bindings are derived from the **observed** buttons — the label on the button decides which recipe runs, and a slot whose label no longer matches any action is left unmapped rather than guessed. Adversarial testing had the intended ordering published instead, so an `ALPHA` button ran `bravo`.
- **Stage 2 limitations — state these up front whenever you touch the ribbon.**
  1. There are **32 slots**. Registration is capped at 32, so nothing is normally pending, but any action past the pool comes back in `tab.pending_actions` — registered and ordered, with no button.
  2. `tab.status = "stale"` means Hangul handed back a tree it had cached under that tab key instead of what was just inserted — reproduced live by forcing a burned key to be reused. Random keys make that unreachable in normal operation, but the verdict is still made by *observing* the ribbon rather than trusting the inserts, so it is reported if it ever happens. Report `tab.ribbon_stale_labels` as measured, and note that click routing follows those observed labels.
- Mutating calls rebuild the whole tab (delete the old key, then build under a new one) so the ribbon mirrors the registry. If Hangul is not running, the registry change still succeeds and the response carries `tab.status = "deferred"` with a `reason_code`; the tab appears by itself once Hangul is up and the worker discovers it. If a COM call fails while the live UI is being touched, `tab.status = "failed"`; `reason_code = "process_died"` means Hangul went away — do not treat that as a benign deferral.
- `hwp_list_custom_actions` marks any step whose tool no longer exists (or was never allowed) in this profile as `resolved: false` and repeats it in `unresolved_step_tools`.

## Official source of truth

For an explicit request with the intent of “공식 API 찾아봐”, “API 열어봐”, “API 확인”, “명세 확인”, or an equivalent expression, do not switch profiles. In production, call `hwp_search_tools` with the user's lookup text as `query` and `include_official_api=true`. This route reads only the packaged official catalog, returns at most five detailed matches, and applies only to that call; it stores no enabled state, so the next call is automatically off. Narrow a follow-up lookup by sending the returned exact identifier as `query` with the same per-call flag and a small `limit`.

For explicit catalog coverage analysis, use the same production gateway with `tool_name="hwp_get_official_api_coverage"` and `arguments={}`. In the QA profile the two tools remain directly callable. Both paths are generated from the official 2025-04 PDFs; do not substitute memory or inferred names.
